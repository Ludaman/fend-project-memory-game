## Instructions

This is my Udacity project for the Memory Game.  I did this by taking the starter code from Udacity.  I added 1-2 lines to the HTML file to allow for JQuery and a class on the ul element allowing me to find that element.  The bulk of my modifications were to the JavaScript file.
## Contributing

I used the Udacity starter project and modified it.
