# Memory Game Project By Jeff Choate

This is a small Javascript game I created for a Udacity project in learning how to use Javascript.  The game randomly fills out a board of cards for you to flip over and try to find matches.  Be wary, a perfect 3 stars requires an immense amount of luck!

## Instructions

To play the game click the the blank cards and they will flip over revealing the symbol to be matched.  When you flip over two they will turn green if they match and if they do not match they will flip over after a short time and add to your move count.  

If you want to start over then you can click the restart button that looks like a round arrow.  

## Dependencies

This project uses Javascript, JQuery, and the Font-Awesome CSS font.
